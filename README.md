*Status:* Abandoned

Version 3.0.0 is the final version of this extension.  As of November 2014 this extension does NOT work with Facebook.  I have decided to stop mantaining this extension because Facebook's new update has a built in Select All feature, making this extensions superfluous.

Thank you all for your support.
